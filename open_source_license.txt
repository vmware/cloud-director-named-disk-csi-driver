       Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)

       "This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by
       Google as part of the Go project.

       Google hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
       no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
       patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
       transfer and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of this
       implementation of Go, where such license applies only to those patent
       claims, both currently owned or controlled by Google and acquired in
       the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily infringed by this
       implementation of Go.  This grant does not include claims that would be
       infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this
       implementation.  If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or
       order or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any
       entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
       that this implementation of Go or any code incorporated within this
       implementation of Go constitutes direct or contributory patent
       infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then any patent
       rights granted to you under this License for this implementation of Go
       shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

       "This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by
       Google as part of the Go project.

       Google hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
       no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
       patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
       transfer and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of this
       implementation of Go, where such license applies only to those patent
       claims, both currently owned or controlled by Google and acquired in
       the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily infringed by this
       implementation of Go.  This grant does not include claims that would be
       infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this
       implementation.  If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or
       order or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any
       entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
       that this implementation of Go or any code incorporated within this
       implementation of Go constitutes direct or contributory patent
       infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then any patent
       rights granted to you under this License for this implementation of Go
       shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty- free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of
their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)
was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.
You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works

  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
     that You changed the files; and

  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that
     You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
     notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
     that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
     include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
     the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part
     of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
     if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
     generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
     notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
     informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
     may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
     You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
     from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
     cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own
     copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional
     or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
     distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works
     as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the
     Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional

supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on
an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised
of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and
hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
warranty or additional liability.
